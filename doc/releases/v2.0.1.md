This maintenance release adds a simple installer for Windows. While the GOL Tool is just a single self-contained executable, Windows often treats standalone `.exe` files with suspicion and may block the download.

You may still see a SmartScreen warning when running the installer. If that happens, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

As always, you can also build the `gol` executable from source using CMake 3.15+ and a C++20 compiler.
