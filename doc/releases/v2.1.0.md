This release enables support for the Geo-Object Bundle (GOB) format, a tightly compressed, fast-to-import representation of a GOL (typically half the size of a GOL and 30% smaller than OSM-PBF)

# New functionality

- `gol load`: Import tiles from a GOB

- `gol save`: Export tiles from a GOL as a GOB
